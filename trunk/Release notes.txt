GRATF 1.0.0 release notes
------------------------------
05.11.2010.

First release of the project. Based on AForge.NET framework v.2.1.4

It includes:

- A prototype of glyph recognition algorithm, which is implemented as a
  plug-in to IPPrototyper tool from AForge.NET framework. Can be used
  for demonstrating glyph recognition algorithm's idea step by step or
  for its further improvement, debugging and testing.
  
- Glyph Recognition Studio - an application which does recognition of glyphs
  in video streams (video files or local capture devices, like web cameras).
  Also the application does 2D augmented reality - puts images into video
  feed replacing recognized glyphs - virtual objects in real world.

- Glyph recognition library, which is an extension to AForge.NET framework.
  The library can be reused in other applications which require glyph
  recognition functionality.
